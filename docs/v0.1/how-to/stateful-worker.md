# Create a Stateful Worker

## Description

In this example we implement a naive polish calculator, and it stores it's
calculator state every time an actor fails or terminates.

The following example:

* defines a set of operations that can be performed to worker via the
  `CalculatorOperation` record
* reads a backup from a filepath everytime it runs
* writes backup to a filepath everytime it is terminated (using `workerOnTerminationL`)
* writes backup to a filepath everytime it fails (using `workerOnFailureL`)
* creates a worker spec with behavior defined above
* creates a capataz system and a worker (using worker specification)
* executes a few operations to showcase calculator usage
* waits a few milliseconds to give the calculator worker some leeway
* tears down the capataz system and show results of teardown operation
